	Experiment with running the stream operations
	in Threads/cp/threads/MultiDownloader inside of a ForkJoinPool.
	
	Try with different number of threads (the parallelism parameter of the
	constructor of ForkJoinPool).
	What is the effect? How many threads is it good to have?
	
	Try also adding more URLs to the list of URLs to download.
	Does having more or less URLs influence the number of
	threads that it is good to have?
